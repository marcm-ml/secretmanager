- config/settings via file, env.vars, etc similar to prefect
- prefix/suffix support for each manager
- mapping support per-manager
- ~~filtering support globally by key~~
- populate os.environ when using .get()?
- caching: per-manager or globally?
- integrate with pydantic models
- integrate with pydantic-settings secret model (maybe? the same as above?)
- decorator to inject secret into a function given some kwargs and a secret-id
- refine store/default store
